## Downlaoding, cleansing and preparing GSE14468 data

The basic idea of analyzing GSE data is first convert it to a **SummarizedExperiment** object, because this format is widely used nowadays and I am more familiar with this format.
To do this, I can refer to this year's Bioconductor workshop:
1. download the dataset of interest with GEOquery package:
```R
library(GEOquery)
gse14468 <- getGEO("GSE14468")[[1]]
```
**note** that a GSE may consist of multiple platforms, thus the [[n]] should change accordingly

2. convert the GSE to SummarizedExperiment:
```R
library(SummarizedExperiment)
se = as(gse14468, "SummarizedExperiment")

# set column names
colnames(expr) <- colData(se)$title

# convert to data.frame
expr <- as.data.frame(expr)

# add gene symbol
expr$gene <- rowData(se)$Gene.Symbol

# collapse multiple probes to gene
