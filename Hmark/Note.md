## About "Bivalent chromotin":
### Notion (form [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivalent_chromatin)):
> Bivalent chromatin are segments of DNA, bound to histone proteins, that have _**both repressing and activating epigenetic regulators in the same region**_. These regulators work to enhance or silence the expression of genes. Since these regulators work in opposition to each other, they normally interact with chromatin at **different times**. However, in bivalent chromatin, both types of regulators are **interacting with the same domain at the same time**. Bivalent chromatin domains are normally associated with promoters of transcription factor genes that are expressed at low levels. Bivalent domains have also been found to play a role in developmental regulation in **pluripotent embryonic stems cells**, as well as **gene imprinting**.
> **Bivalent epigenetic regulators**:  The most common antagonistic epigenetic regulators found together on bivalent chromatin domains are methylation marks on histone 3 lysine 4 (**H3K4me3**) and histone 3 lysine 27 (**H3K27me3**). The H3K27me3 mark silences the gene while the H3K4me3 mark allows the gene to _not be permanently silenced_, and _activated when needed_. Embryonic stem cells and imprinted genes are associated with both activating (H3K4me3) and repressive (H3K27me3) marks, as they _**allow a gene to be repressed until activation is needed**_. Although there is abundant evidence for co-localization of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 at the same location in the genome, most evidence suggests that they **do not occur on the same molecule but may occur on _different copies of histone H3_ within the same nucleosome**.

### This notion is originally proposed in:
[A Bivalent Chromatin Structure Marks Key Developmental Genes in Embryonic Stem Cells](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867406003801), Cell, 2006

They proposed:
> We identified a specific modification pattern, termed **“bivalent domains,”** consisting of **large regions of H3 lysine 27 methylation harboring smaller regions of H3 lysine 4 methylation**. Bivalent domains tend to coincide with TF genes expressed at low levels. _We propose that bivalent domains **silence developmental genes in ES cells** while **keeping them poised for activation**._

And they suggest this pattern is specific to ES cells:
> Thus, the majority of TSSs that show bivalent domains in ES cells **do not show bivalent domains in the differentiated cells**.

> Thus, bivalent domains appear **largely specific to ES cells** and, in differentiated cells, developmental genes are instead frequently organized within expansive regions showing either repressive or activating modifications.
