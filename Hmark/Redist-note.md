# Note on redistribution of Hist/DNA modifications

## DNA methylation redistribution:
[DNA methylation in cancer: too much, but also too little](https://www.nature.com/articles/1205651#ref102) Oncogene, 2002

#### This is a widely cited (800+) review on DNA methylation patterns in cancer, the two main points are:
> 1. Genomic **hypermethylation** in cancer has been observed most often in **CpG islands** in gene regions.
> 2. In contrast, **very frequent hypomethylation** is seen in both **highly and moderately repeated DNA sequences** in cancer, including heterochromatic DNA repeats, dispersed retrotransposons, and endogenous retroviral elements.
